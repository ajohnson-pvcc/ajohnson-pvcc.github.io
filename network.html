                    <ul>CSMA/CD Ethernet(Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection) - Dictates that each message be broadcast to all machines on the bus. . Each 
                        machine monitors all the messages but keeps only those addressed to itself. 
                        To transmit a message, a machine waits until the bus is silent, and at this time 
                        it begins transmitting while continuing to monitor the bus. If another machine 
                        also begins transmitting, both machines detect the clash and pause for a brief, 
                        independently random period of time before trying to transmit again. The 
                        result is a system similar to that used by a small group of people in a conversation. If two people start to talk at once, they both stop. T</ul>
                    <ul>CSMA/CA Wifi - The protocol used is similar to Ethernet’s CSMA/CD. The basic 
                        difference is that when a machine first needs to transmit a message and finds 
                        the communication channel si1lent, it does not start transmitting immediately. 
                        Instead, it waits for a short period of time and then starts transmitting only 
                        if the channel has remained silent throughout that period. If a busy channel 
                        is experienced during this process, the machine waits for a randomly determined period before trying again. Once this period is exhausted, the machine 
                        is allowed to claim a silent channel without hesitation. This means that collisions between “newcomers” and those that have already been waiting are 
                        avoided because a “newcomer” is not allowed to claim a silent channel until 
                        any machine that has been waiting is given the opportunity to start</ul>

                    <ul>bridge - Connects two buses, but doesnt necessarily pass all messages across the connection. Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each 
                        message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side. Thus, two machines residing 
                        on the same side of a bridge can exchange messages without interfering with 
                        communication taking place on the other side. </ul>
                    <ul>switch - a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather that just two. Considers the destination addresses of all messages and forwards only those messages destined for other spokes. Each message that is forwarded is relayed only into the appropriate spokem thus minimizing the traffic in each spoke. </ul>
