        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Established in 1977 by the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, going into effect October 1, 1997, the Department of Energy (DOE) was the twelfth cabinet-level department. 
            The DOE was created to weave together various Federally establish programs under the umbrella purpose of controlling the development, research, and funding of programs related to anything nuclear as well as other various energy and physical science programs in disparate parts of the Federal Government.
            Prior to the establishment of the DOE, the Federal government played a limited role in national energy policy with most research, development, and policy residing the private sector with minimal regulation. 
            Nuclear research, development, and regulation was handled by the Atomic Energy Commission established in 1946 following the success of the Manhattan Project but was disbanded shortly prior to the establishment of the DOE and replaced with the Energy Research and Development Administration and Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1974, both of which fell under the umbrella of the DOE later on. 
            An energy crisis beginning in the 1970s combined with contentions about separation of regulatory bodies from the development and production of nuclear power and weapons.           
        </p>
            <p>
Over the years, the primary focus of the DOE has shifted depending on the every changing energy needs of the country. Following its creation, the focus of the department was primarily energy development and regulations. In the late 80s the focus shifted to nuclear weapons research, development, and regulations during the height of the Cold War. 
Following the end of the Cold War, the DOE's focus changed once again towards the environmental clean-up of nuclear weapons and related research and production.
 In more recent times, focus has once again been shifting toward other policies such as Climate change, alternative Energy sources, and large scientific research funding.

               <h2>Education and Funding</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to directly funding research and development of new technologies, the DOE also provides resources for education via it's <a href="https://www.energy.gov/stem-rising"> STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Rising</a> iniative. 
                The STEM RISING project collects, provides resouces, and helps connect organizations related to the fields of STEM at every level of education as well as providing intership opportunities for emerging STEM students. For small bussiness there are a series of programs known as the SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) AND SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (STTR) PROGRAMS that were created to provide grants to those performing R&D in areas which are supported by the DOE.
                These SBIR/STTR are specifically aimed at bussinesses that seek to advance and create commercially successful/marketable products and ideas.
                Additional funding is currently being gived by the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) within the DOE with the aim to develop "Cleaner" energy technologies related to fossil fuel use.
                Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy(ARPA-E) grants funding to projects that are deemed to have high-potential, but are not neccesarily ready for a commerical market or private funding.
